# Hunt the Wumpus
Recreation of the "Hunt the Wumpus" game, created for web platform.
We will use Node JS, and the Cytoscape.js library

## ⚙️ Tecnologies
This recreation of "Hunt the Wumpus" will run entirely on web client-side. This project doesn't need an structured backend service to work properly, only a server to host this web app.

Therefore, in order to make this app funcitonal, this project is using Node.js with Express to create a simple server to allow users to launch and/or host it.

By the other hand, to handle graphs visualization (because of game requirements), this project is using Cytoscape to reach this goal.
